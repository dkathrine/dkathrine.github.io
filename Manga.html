    <div>
        <p class="toptxt">
            Manga are comics or graphic novels originating from Japan. Most manga conform to a style developed in Japan in the late 19th century, and the form has a long prehistory in earlier Japanese art. The term manga is used in Japan to refer to both comics and cartooning. Outside of Japan, the word is typically used to refer to comics originally published in the country.

            Manhwa is the general Korean term for comics and print cartoons.
            Outside Korea, the term usually refers to South Korean comics, Manhwa is a notable part of South Korean culture.

                Ten years ago, "the Gate" appeared and connected the real world with the realm of magic and monsters. To combat these vile beasts, ordinary people received superhuman powers and became known as "Hunters." Twenty-year-old Sung Jin-Woo is one such Hunter, but he is known as the "World's Weakest," owing to his pathetic power compared to even a measly E-Rank. Still, he hunts monsters tirelessly in low-rank Gates to pay for his mother's medical bills.

                However, this miserable lifestyle changes when Jin-Woo—believing himself to be the only one left to die in a mission gone terribly wrong—awakens in a hospital three days later to find a mysterious screen floating in front of him. This "Quest Log" demands that Jin-Woo completes an unrealistic and intense training program, or face an appropriate penalty.

                King Grey has unrivaled strength, wealth, and prestige in a world governed by martial ability. However, solitude lingers closely behind those with great power. Beneath the glamorous exterior of a powerful king lurks the shell of man, devoid of purpose and will.

                Reincarnated into a new world filled with magic and monsters, the king has a second chance to relive his life. Correcting the mistakes of his past will not be his only challenge, however. Underneath the peace and prosperity of the new world is an undercurrent threatening to destroy everything he has worked for, questioning his role and reason for being born again.

                Yuu Koito has always enjoyed romance manga and love songs. She clings to them with the hope that she will one day experience a love story of her own—one that will sweep her off her feet and make her heart flutter. However, reality is often disappointing. When a classmate from junior high confesses his feelings to her, Yuu finds that she feels nothing. Unable to give him an answer, she becomes convinced that she is unable to fall in love.

                One day, on her way to the student council room, Yuu encounters the council's president, Touko Nanami, turning down a confession from a boy. Inspired by Touko's confidence, Yuu turns to her for help. But when Touko becomes the next person to confess to Yuu, she is confused, yet her heart is set aflutter.

                Yuzu Aihara is a girl who loves fashion and is always worried about her appearance. She likes to go out with her friends, but has never kissed or dated anyone before. But her life turns upside down when her mother remarries and Yuzu is transferred to a very strict all-girls school, where she can't wear makeup and earrings or even bring a cellphone. Deciding to rebel, she dresses how she likes on her first day, and because of that, she is called out in front of the entire school by the student council president: Mei Aihara, a girl who is the complete opposite of Yuzu.

                To make her situation worse, when Yuzu gets home, she finds out that she has a new sister, and it turns out to be none other than Mei herself. Annoyed with the circumstances, the student council president kisses her, in an effort to prove a point. However, everything changes when Yuzu seems to like it and can't stop thinking about it.
